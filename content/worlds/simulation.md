The Simulation Hypothesis[\[@wiki\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulation_hypothesis) proposes that we live in a simulated reality.

 - There are many possibilities around what might be "doing" the simulating, from a superintelligent AI to a lab experiment.
 - It's not exactly a *nice* simulation, but might not be that nasty.  It could easily include protection from extremes of suffering.
 - We can speculate about *why* we might be here.  Could it be a prison sentence, or a means of coercion?  "Yes your life was OK but we could have easily given you a more unpleasant one, so do what we say or you're back in there!"
 - All things become possible, including an appeal to the admins of the simulation.
 - There might already be people around with the ability to control the simulation.
 - AI might be able to exploit features if the simulation we either can't or don't know about.
