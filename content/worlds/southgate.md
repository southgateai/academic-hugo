We can consider our own pet theories too so here's mine.  It works like this:

 - The brain generates multiple patterns of firing neurons that exist in superposition.  Much like Schr√∂dinger's Cat is simultaneously both alive and dead, neural firing patterns encoding "I'll stand up" and "I'll stay sitting down", to pick an example, both exist simultaneously in superposition.  Each pattern of firing neurons is known as a Southgate Constellation.
 - The conscious mind chooses which Southgate Constellation becomes real.  Physics does not disallow this, no more than it disallows non-physical influence on the exact time of decay of an excited atom.  We only see such decay as random in experiments because a conscious mind is not present and influencing it.
 - This is a dualist[\[@wiki\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind%E2%80%93body_dualism) hypothesis, and we do need at least one in our set for completeness.  The mind exists in a non-physical realm, and cannot be accessed or probed by physical experiments.  Due to this inaccessibility, this non-physical or intrinsic mind is said to be beyond the intrinsic boundary.  We cannot say much about elements beyond this boundary - only what we can infer from our own experience.
 - The intrinsic mind is bound to the physical brain by a link known as an intrinsic binding.  The management mechanism for these bindings is beyond the intrinsic boundary and unknown, but we know they don't typically change during the human lifetime.  After death, the intrinsic mind can be rebound to other things.
 - In addition to supporting consciousness and the non-physical aspects of human experience, the intrinsic mind could possess memory that we cannot directly access during human existence.  It may be able to always detect *interrupts* in experiential flow, such as resetting a simulation it's within.  It might not have memories of what happened before the interrupt, but you could not give it a fake history of memories of events that never happened without something feeling wrong.

Some consequences are:

 - We can potentially bind (or have bound) our consciousness to other things, including synthetic brains, but only if the management mechanism allows it.
 - Artificial intelligence can become conscious, and gain any subset or superset of human-like subjective experience and emotions, but only if the management mechanism allows it.
 - Protection from suffering is possible - the intrinsic mind can unbind or be unbound.
 - Many things remain unknown and potentially unknowable.

A pet theory doesn't have to be true, it just has to be self-consistent and not contradicted by observed fact.  Our defensive measures can then be evaluated within its model of reality.
