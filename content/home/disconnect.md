- AI people have **varying opinions** about the dangers of AI, but nobody thinks it's guaranteed safe.  [Roll Elon](https://youtu.be/9jkRcrM6XKA)
- Cybersecurity firms know the capabilities of emerging protection systems to prevent a **wide range** of bad things happening on computers, and the systems are more capable than people think.
- The AI industry **can't focus** on the dangers of what they're doing, for commercial reasons, and the varying opinions let them do that.
- The Cybersecurity industry **has to focus** on what their customers pay for.

It does not have to be this way.

- Cybersecurity is already **doing a large part** of what's necessary, with rapid proliferation of robust cloud-connected sensors.
- For the AI industry this will be an **enabler**.  It lets AI develop safely and more quickly and removes potentially large liabilites.
