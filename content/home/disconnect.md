- AI people have **varying opinions** about the dangers of AI, but almost nobody thinks it's guaranteed safe.
- Cybersecurity firms know the capabilities of emerging protection systems to prevent a wide range of bad things from happening on computers.  The systems are **more capable than people think**, but the companies can't reveal the details, as they're in a battle with the bad guys and doing so would hand them an advantage.
- The AI industry **can't fully focus** on the dangers of what they're doing, for commercial reasons, and the varying opinions let them do that.
- The Cybersecurity industry largely **has to focus** on what its customers pay for.

You can connect these aims.

- Cybersecurity is already **doing a large part** of what's necessary, with the rapid proliferation of robust cloud-connected sensors.
- For the AI industry, defensive measures can be a great **enabler**.  They let AI develop safely and more quickly and reduce the chance of potentially large liabilities.
- Cybersecurity can make money both by **preventing AI disasters and providing that enabler**.
