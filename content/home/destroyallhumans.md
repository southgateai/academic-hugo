If there's one thing we don't want humankind's legacy to be, it's a boring universe dedicated entirely to making paperclips.  Yes, that can happen.  But so long as the power to recreate things exists, is there any reason to preserve anything?  Ourselves included?

Can you just create people, if you have the right recipe?  Can you even make most of that recipe up?

This just makes plotting a safe future way more complicated than it already is.
