<div class="fa-3x"><i class="fa-solid fa-paperclip fa-beat" style="--fa-beat-scale: 1.35;"></i></div><span>If there's one thing we don't want humankind's legacy to be, it's a boring universe dedicated entirely to making paperclips.  But so long as the power to recreate things exists, is there any reason to preserve anything?  Ourselves included?</span>
