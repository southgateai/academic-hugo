- When building a defence, it **matters when you start**, as well as how much effort and resources you apply.
- There's a **lot more we can do** than immediately comes to mind, especially if we have the time.  For example a specialised module built into each computer chip we make.
- Superintelligence **doesn't necessarily win**.  It's not clear how it could deal with a perfectly laid (cyber)minefield.
