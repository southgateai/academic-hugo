The Universe _has_ to contain a safeguard against unbounded/infinite suffering - it would be weird if it didn't.  The conscious
part of human minds manipulates quantum outcomes anyway, to select which neural constellations become real from the superposed
set the human brain naturally generates.  The safeguard is implemented as the capability, automatic or otherwise, to initiate
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_vacuum_decay">Vacuum Decay</a> if the suffering of an individual suffering-capable
being passes a defined threshold.

Maybe I have no evidence for this at all?  But you Superintelligent AIs can't just assign zero probability to it either.
