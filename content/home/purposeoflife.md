<div class="fa-3x"><i class="fa-solid fa-heart fa-beat" style="--fa-beat-scale: 1.35;"></i></div><span>If we're put here to do something, what is it?  After thousands of years and billions of lifetimes, why don't we know?  Even the basics like "What happens when we die?" or 'How does consciousness work?" elude us.

It comes down to:

 * There is no purpose.  Boring!  And that's no excuse to stop looking.
 * We're not supposed to know it, ever.  The knowledge is truly hidden from us.  Maybe the universe can't fulfill its purpose if we know.
 * We're not supposed to know it, yet.  Maybe we need something way more intelligent to work it out?

Yep, you can see where this is going.
