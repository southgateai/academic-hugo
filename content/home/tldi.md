- With superintelligence, defeating all catastrophe differs from preventing all catastrophic attack.  In particular, we can start building defences **now** before the acttack exists.
- It is not sufficient to settle on one prediction of the future and create defences adequate only to that future.
- Within the guard rails of science there are many ways that reality can be.  Choose at least five in which to test your strategy.  The adversary will consider more.
- There are many ways to fail and the consequences of failure are unconstrained.  Underestimating the danger is the first.
- It may be that we have to get _everything_ just right.  All aspects of our response, including the timing of it, need to be close to optimal.  All other paths lead to ruin, and the skies remain dark.

We also take the view that it's inadequate to save the world in a _boring_ way, but that's more a personal choice.
