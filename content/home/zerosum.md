Is joy and suffering a zero-sum - you can't have one without the other?  Must any joy or happiness you experience be balanced by the opposite of joy at some other time?

Yep, if true, this one throws an **enormous spanner in the works** when you're trying to make the world a better place.

It is at least one way where the universe starts to make sense.  If you were a superbeing that wanted to rack up some points on the suffering side, and you could create any universe for yourself to live in for a while to score those points, wouldn't it look like this one?

It even works over small and large timescales.

| Action                                                                | Consequence                                            |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| You drink beer :smiley:                                               | You get a hangover :worried:                           |
| You have a regular sufferfest on the exercise machine :worried:       | You enjoy fitness and good health :smiley:             |
| You try to avoid something unpleasant you don't want to face :smiley:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;| It ends badly :worried:               |
| You take crystal meth :smiley:                                        | OMG that ends really badly :worried::worried::worried: |
| You face your fears and do the right thing :worried:                  | Good things happen :smiley:                            | 

You can't even get ahead on the joy side over the space of a few days.  What is going on?  Are you just here to fill your quota of suffering so things can be nice for a while in the next life?
