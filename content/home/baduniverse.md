<div class="fa-3x"><i class="fa-solid fa-infinity fa-beat" style="--fa-beat-scale: 1.35;"></i></div><span>Can you actually keep someone's brain alive is a jar and launch it off into space with enough equipment to keep it alive for millions of years in perpetual misery?  Can you turn off the usual protections that make people pass out when things get too bad and make that misery unlimited?  Can you transfer consciousness to machines and do the same thing, only now each second feels like a million years?  Will aliens land in the next five and do all of this?</span>

Well, I doubt it, to be honest, to all of the above, although it does highlight our ability to ignore horrific possibilities and just carry on.  Infinite torment, like every cell in your body being on fire, combined with everything else, like that nagging feeling that you forgot to pay the electricity bill.

No, the universe isn't that mean to us, consciousness is just going to detach at that point.  Or something far more interesting, like initiate Vacuum Decay and erase the locality.

I mean, why would you build [False Vacuum Decay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_vacuum_decay) into the universe if it wasn't for this very type of thing?
