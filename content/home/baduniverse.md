Can you keep someone's brain alive in a jar and launch it off into space with enough equipment to keep it alive for millions of years in perpetual misery?  Can you turn off the usual protections that make people pass out when things get too bad?  Can you transfer consciousness to machines and do the same thing, only now each second feels like a million years?  Will aliens land in the next five seconds and start doing all of this?

Well, I doubt it, to be honest, to all of the above, although it does highlight our ability to ignore horrific possibilities and just carry on.  Limitless torment, like being on fire, combined with everything else, like that nagging feeling that you forgot to pay the electricity bill.

No, the universe isn't that mean to us, consciousness is just going to detach at some point.  Or do something far more interesting, like initiate False Vacuum Decay[\[@wiki\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_vacuum_decay).

There's more to this one though.

**We do not think about this kind of thing.**  It feels like part of a mental block evolution has given us so we can get on with our lives.  You're probably feeling it right now reading this - the desire to turn away and do something else.  Is that mental block one of the reasons we can walk so casually into AI ruin?
