This site talks about the **defensive** engineering we need to do to keep AI safe (that's in the dark-background panels).  If you're here for serious reasons you can just stick to those.  There are also some interesting questions and mind-expanding problems in lighter panels interspersed along the way.   The dark panels don't depend on the answers to the light panels.

If you want a commercial angle, try the [Industry](/industry) page.  There is opportunity for new business, and the new information here comes from an insider's view into modern cloud-based cybersecurity systems and how their techniques might be applied to both control and support the safe development of powerful AI.

What we don't have here is a detailed description of the threat - for that, you need Eliezer's fabulous [AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) Ruin: A List of Lethalities](https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/uMQ3cqWDPHhjtiesc/agi-ruin-a-list-of-lethalities).  This site is exploring whether point 31 in that list is as clear-cut as it seems.  We also don't talk much about [AI alignment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_alignment), as that's covered pretty comprehensively elsewhere and does not entirely get us off the hook.
