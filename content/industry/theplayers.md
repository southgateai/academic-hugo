The focus is on companies with sensor-based technology that feeds data into a larger Cloud ecosystem.

 - [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/), with a larger interest in Cybersecurity [than you might think](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/cybersecurity).
 - [CrowdStrike](https://www.crowdstrike.com/).  For full disclosure - the author's employer.  I don't speak for them, but I do get the insider's viewpoint.
 - [Trend Micro](https://www.trendmicro.com), with reference to their [endpoint sensor](https://www.trendmicro.com/en_hk/business/products/user-protection/sps/endpoint/endpoint-sensor.html).
 - [SentinelOne](https://www.sentinelone.com/).
 
**These** are the companies we need to influence.  Indirect influence might be the most effective, if we can get customers express their curiosity.
