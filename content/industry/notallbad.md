On the plus side, industry **knows things that other groups might not**.

 - [AI alignment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_alignment) - controlling AI by giving it a benevolent set of goals - is neither easy nor great at its job.
   - Not least because once powerful AI technology exists it can just be repurposed with a more dangerous set of goals.
 - The idea of 'sensor' software on countless millions of computers, sending a second-by-second account of what that computer is doing, for complex problem-spotting analysis and response in the Cloud.
It might sound far-fetched and unachievable, but it already happens, every day.
