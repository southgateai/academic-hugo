Will we see another era of cybersecurity?

 - **EDR[\[@wiki\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endpoint_detection_and_response) - Endpoint Detection and Response** (2013).  Technology that continually monitors an "endpoint" (for example a laptop, mobile phone, IoT device) to mitigate threats.
 - **XDR[\[@wiki\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_detection_and_response) - Extended Detection and Response** (2018). Technology that continually collects and correlates data across various network points such as servers, email, cloud workloads, and endpoints to mitigate threats.
 - **GDR - General Detection and Response.**  Technology that continually collects and correlates data from all relevant sources to mitigate threats from Artificial General Intelligence.

If so, the field is wide open.
