Fortunately, you don't need to build large-scale cloud infrastructure and manage millions of installed sensors yourself, because the people that do have App Stores.  [Here's one](https://www.sentinelone.com/partners/singularity-marketplace/), [and another](https://store.crowdstrike.com/).  Put simply, you can build your own app to consume the event streams from these platforms and make its own judgments about whether the activity is good or bad.  Now, this would be a mere shadow of the system you'd need to manage superintelligent AI, but current AI is also a mere shadow of superintelligent AI.  All an app has to do is prove viability and provide some value to gain a foothold.  Its capability can then be extended as required.
