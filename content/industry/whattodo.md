In an ideal world, we'd like:

 - People in the AI industry to know about the defensive options - especially how they _enable_ more rapid, safer AI development.
 - People in the Cybersecurity firms to apply some focus to defending against _future_ AI threats, and not just AI-powered malware.
 - Customers of those firms to be savvy about the marketing but conscious of the future threat.
