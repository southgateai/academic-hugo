To sum up, **there is not much focus on defensive techniques**.

 - Those in the AI sector focus on getting their stuff to work.  [AI alignment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_alignment) is their principal approach to preventing problems.
 - The Cybersecurity industry knows about the industry's potential to control powerful AI but rarely pursues or talks about it.
 - Or when they do, it's marketing-led.  There are plenty of examples if you search for [AI-powered malware](https://www.google.com/search?q=AI-powered+malware).

They don't talk about threats that might be one or more years in the future, as it's not good marketing and might harm their credibility for no or little gain.
 - Corporate customers generally aren't aware of or are suspicious of the marketing.
