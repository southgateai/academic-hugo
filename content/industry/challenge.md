To sum up, **there is not much focus on defence**.

 - Those in the AI sector focus on getting their stuff to work.  [AI alignment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_alignment) is their principal approach to prevent problems.
 - The Cybersecurity industry knows about their industry's potential to control powerful AI but rarely pursue or talk about it.
 - Or when they do, it's [marketing-led](https://www.darktrace.com/en/ai-attacks/).  There's plenty of examples if you search for [AI-powered malware](https://www.google.com/search?q=AI-powered+malware).

They don't talk about threats that might be 10+ years in the futures, as it's not good marketing and might harm their credibility for no or little gain.
 - Corporate customers generally aren't aware, or are suspicious of the marketing, especially given that opinion pieces correctly point out that [Effective AI-powered attacks have not been seen yet](https://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/opinions/ai-powered-malware-doesnt-exist/).
