**Status:** Considered self evident  
**Provisos:** Optimisation to a 'lucky guess' of the nature (or subset of natures) of reality can outperform the wider posture  
  
This postulate extends the problem set to include a selected subset of all plausible views of the constitution of reality.  In particular the
[materialist nature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Materialism), or any nature where conscious experience arises solely from physical processes
within the brain, is only one of many plausible natures considered.  The alternative nature postulated here to illustrate is that macroscopic
superposition, in the style of Schr√∂dinger's Cat, can be extended to a superposition of neural constellations in which 'something external
gets to choose' which constellation is physically realised.  It joins a wide range of objections to materialism, which remains a useful but
potentially falsifiable conjecture.
