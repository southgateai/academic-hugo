Reductive Physicalism[\[@wiki\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physicalism#Reductionism) is, to give it a clumsy summary, the idea that physical matter is all there is, and everything we see, do or feel arises from that.

 - Easy to reason about, although quantum mechanics is still a thing so it's not that easy.
 - Doesn't really explain human experience.  You end up saying "atoms move around" or "information gets processed", and conscious experience arises solely from that.
 - If you're asking questions like "What do we experience after we die?" it's not much help.  Do you come back to life if the same configuration of atoms or information processing regime gets created?
 - Doesn't naturally include protection from extreme suffering.
