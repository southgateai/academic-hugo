When planning our defensive barriers, we can't just pick our favorite interpretation of reality and go with that.  That is a **luxury we don't have**.  If we base our defenses on a mechanistic universe, and we're wrong about that, AI could just breeze through our defenses by finding a non-mechanistic element to exploit.  Worse still, the problem might be **unsolvable** in a mechanistic universe, tempting us to give up and leave solutions undiscovered.

Fortunately, we don't have to solve all the problems of modern philosophy before we can move on.  It's a decent start to pick say five world models, plus a few optional features, and see how our defenses stand up in each of them.

This is no big deal, we're just picking a set of possibilities to make sure we have a broad range of options covered because, when it comes to the Nature of Reality, we don't really know.
