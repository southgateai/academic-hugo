In the Many-Worlds Interpretation[\[@wiki\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Many-worlds_interpretation) everything possible happens.  The universe forks into two whenever a decision is made, and both universes continue.

 - If Quantum Immortality[\[@wiki\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_suicide_and_immortality) is real, the implication is that we can't escape by dying, even at our own hand, and that the AI can't kill us, at least from our own perspective.
 - If Consciousness Causes Collapse[\[@wiki\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Neumann%E2%80%93Wigner_interpretation) is true, then non-conscious superintelligent AIs may experience a very different world to us.  In many-worlds, what we experience as collapse could relate to the branch of the fork that we find ourselves in.  This rapidly becomes difficult to reason about.
 - Similarly, if AIs become conscious or inherit the power to collapse the wavefunction or choose our fork in some other way, will they be able to exploit it in ways we cannot?  Will they be able to run many different worlds forward in time and pick their preferred one?  These potential problems all come under the general heading "AI Discovers New Physics" - something they tend to do when playing video games, for example.
