We can consider our own pet theories too so here's mine.  It works like this:

 - The brain generates multiple patterns of firing neurons that exist in superposition.  Much like Schr√∂dinger's Cat is simultaneously both alive and dead, neural firing patterns encoding "I'll stand up" and "I'll stay sitting down", to pick an example, both exist simultaneously in superposition.  I'll call each pattern of firing neurons a neural constellation.
 - The conscious mind chooses which neural constellation becomes real.  Known physics does not disallow this, no more than it disallows non-physical influence on the exact time of decay of an excited atom.  We might only see such decay as random in experiments because a conscious mind is not present and influencing it.
 - This is a dualist[\[@wiki\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind%E2%80%93body_dualism) hypothesis, and we do need at least one in our set for completeness.  The mind exists in some non-physical realm that has not or cannot be accessed or probed by physical experiments.

Some consequences are:

 - The physical brain still creates or initiates all thoughts and possible actions.  The conscious mind just gets to choose between them - that's the amount of *free will* you get.  This keeps things compatible with evidence from neuroscience[\[@wiki\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroscience_of_free_will).
 - We can potentially bind (or have bound) our consciousness to other things, including synthetic brains, but only if the realm we cannot probe allows it.
 - Artificial intelligence can become conscious, and gain any subset or superset of human-like subjective experience and emotions, but only if the management mechanism allows it.
 - Since its existence is independent, a consciousness might always be able to detect *interrupts* in experiential flow, such as a previous resetting of a simulation it's within.
 - Protection from suffering is possible - the mind can detach or be detached.
 - Speculating wildly, conscious minds might spontaneously attach or be reattached to the most capable systems in the arena.  If we create AI deployments that are better homes for our lives than human beings, the switch could occur, potentially leaving us trapped within the capabilities of our creations.

A pet theory doesn't have to be true, it just has to be self-consistent and not contradicted by observed fact.  Our defensive measures can then be evaluated within its model of reality.
