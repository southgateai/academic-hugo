In the future, there is powerful AI, and there are defences trying to ensure that good things happen and bad things do not.  Those defences might simply be a human within reach of an off switch, or they might be the most comprehensive and effective defence system that it's possible to create.  As you turn the dial as to how effective the defences are, at some point the defenders win.  In predicting the future we need to decide how far it's possible to turn that dial, and whether anything prevents us from turning it far enough.
