If we conclude that there is no stable end state that includes powerful AI, the universe inevitably moves towards a state where singularly focused AIs merely battle it out for resources with no higher purpose, then we're in a quandary.  Fortunately, some of our [natures of reality](/worlds) largely forbid that, so it's not time to give up, at least until we know what reality we're in.  But is there such a stable state, even in tricky natures of reality and if so, how do we get to it?

The worlds of Physicalism seem the most difficult.  Does a large number of AIs that all police each other represent a stable state?  Or do the most single-minded resource gatherers gradually win out, doing everything they can to enhance their own computational power in an attempt to attain supremacy?

Many of these long-term doom scenarios are fragile and vulnerable to new discoveries in physics that might happen along the way.  For me, it's not possible to predict the future to a degree where we can say that there is no viable steady state.  It is simply up to our future selves to plot a way toward it as the way becomes clear.

Whether this steady state of Nirvana exists or not, it's still possible to **miss it entirely and end up with very bad things**.  So **that** is what we're trying to avoid.
