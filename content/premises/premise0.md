**Status:** Unproven - don’t take this as licence to destroy us all and press undo if it doesn’t work out  
**Provisos:** Critical information and permissions are not irrevocably lost  
  
This premise is an analogue of but not identical to the reversibility of physical law.  Even if humanity cannot be recreated after destruction,
a sufficiently close approximation can in principle be created, so long as there is sufficient information remaining to guide that recreation
and permissions to allow said recreation to function.
