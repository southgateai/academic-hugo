**Status:** Unproven
**Provisos:** Critical state information is not lost
This premise is an analogue of but not identical to, the reversibility of physical law.  Even if humanity cannot be recreated after destruction,
a close approximation can be created, so long as there is sufficient information remaining to guide that recreation.
