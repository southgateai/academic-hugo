Is joy and suffering a zero-sum - you can't have one without the other?  Must any joy or happiness you experience be balanced by the opposite of joy at some other time?

Yep, if true, this one throws an **enormous spanner in the works** when you're trying to make the world a better place.

It is at least one way where the universe starts to make sense.  If you were a superbeing that wanted to rack up some points on the suffering side, and you could create any universe for yourself to live in for a while to score those points, wouldn't it look like this one?
