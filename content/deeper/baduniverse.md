Can you keep someone's brain alive in a jar and launch it off into space with enough equipment to keep it alive for millions of years in perpetual misery?  Can you turn off the usual protections that make people pass out when things get too bad?  Can you transfer consciousness to machines and do the same thing, only now each second feels like a million years?  Will aliens land in the next five seconds and start doing all of this?

Well, I doubt it, to be honest, to all of the above, although it does highlight our ability to ignore horrific possibilities and just carry on.

No, the universe isn't that mean to us, consciousness is just going to detach at some point.  Or do something far more interesting, like initiate False Vacuum Decay[\[@wiki\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_vacuum_decay).

There's more to this one though.  It is difficult to think about this kind of thing.  It feels like part of a mental block evolution has given us so we can get on with our lives.
