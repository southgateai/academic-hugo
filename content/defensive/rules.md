<div class="fa-3x"><i class="fa-solid fa-ruler fa-beat" style="--fa-beat-scale: 1.35;"></i></div>When talking about <strong>rules</strong>, what I mean is a complex, distributed, live-updating system of static, behavioural and historical analysis with many, many components using many techniques, using the same level of technology as the AI it's analysing.  AI introspection, monitoring input and output, and the search oking for bad patterns of behaviour are only parts of that system.  This is just a continuation of the story we're already seeing in current cloud-based cybersecurity.
