One case where defenses don't work is if they're deliberately not present, or even if there are anti-defenses to make an AI catastrophe *more* likely.  One scenario might be hostilities between nations, where one side wants a Doomsday Device it can use to threaten annihilation.  An AI given goals very hostile to the other side and actively aided in its attempt to achieve world domination.

For once, the prospective impossibility of AI Alignment actually helps, albeit we find ourselves relying on Mutually Assured Destruction, again.  Such a weaponized AI couldn't be reliably targeted only at the other side and would stand a strong chance of also destroying its creator.
