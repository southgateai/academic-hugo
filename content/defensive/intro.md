In the future, there will be powerful AI, and there will be defences trying to ensure that good things happen and bad things do not.  Those defences might simply be a human within reach of an off switch, or they might be the most comprehensive and effective defence system that it's possible to create.

As you turn the dial as to how powerful the defences are, at some point the defenders win.  In predicting the future we need to decide how far it's possible to turn that dial, and whether anything prevents us from turning it far enough.

**Can defensive measures be good enough?**
